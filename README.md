# NYC Bikeshare Analysis

## Overview of Analysis: 

The overall purpose of this analysis was to determine the viability of owning a bikesharing business Des Moines, IA. To complete this analysis I started by reviewing the Citibike bikesharing business in NYC to determine the in's and out's of how it works. During this analysis we review a lot of the critical information that needs to be considered for this type of business including the Peak Hours of the day and the peak days, how long users typically checkout bikes, our target market (gender, and Subscribers vs Non-Subscribers), etc. Some things that will potentially need to be adjusted in the future before starting in IA include the potential time the bikes are checked out, as the locations could be farther apart, and obviously the Top Starting and End locations. I would imagine the peak hours and peak days would stay relatively the same.

## Results 

### Peak Hours

![PeakHours](https://github.com/ericajini/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/Peak_Hours.jpg)

In this part of the analysis you can see 2 charts. The top chart can be used to see the peak hours of the day and then the bottom chart can be used to dig further into the peak hours by providing Subscriber/ Non-Subscriber info, along with the number of trips being broken out by gender. The peak hours for this analysis are 5pm and 6pm. In the bottom chart we can see that a majority of these customers are Subscribers and Men. 

### Peak Days

![PeakDays](https://github.com/ericajini/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/Peak_Days.jpg)

In this part of the analysis you can see 2 charts. The top chart can be used to see the peak days of the week and then the bottom chart can be used to dig further into the peak days by providing Subscriber/ Non-Subscriber info, along with the number of trips being broken out by gender. The peak days for this analysis are Thursday and Friday. In the bottom chart we can see that for these days, a majority of these customers are Subscribers and Men. 

### Heatmaps

![Heatmaps](https://github.com/ericajini/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/HeatMaps.jpg)

In the heatmaps page you can see 3 charts, Trips by Weekday per Hour, User Trips by Gender by Weekday, and Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour). In the first chart we can see that the most amount of trips take place and stop around 5 and 6, for Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays. You are also able to filter by the hour. In the second chart we can see that on every day of the week the most trips are being taken by men on Thursdays and Fridays. In the third chart we see similar info as in the first chart by are able to filter by gender. 

### Top Starting Locations

On this page we can see the Top Ending Locations. Some of the top station ids include 514, 519, and 497. 

### Checkout Times for Users

![CheckoutTimesUsers](https://github.com/ericajini/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/Checkout_Times_Users.jpg)

On this page you are able to filter by hours of the day to determine how long bikes are usually checked out. In the image example we can see during 12am - 3am that the average trip time is lasting 10 minutes. 


## Checkout Times for Gender 

![CheckoutTimesGender](https://github.com/ericajini/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/Checkout_Times_Genders.jpg)

On this page you are able to filter by hours of the day to determine how long bikes are usually checked out. The difference from the last page is that you are able to also see a different line for each gender. With that said in the image example we see that more men are taking trips in general, but that woman also checkout bikes around the same amount of time. There is not as much of a spike when the gender is unknown and trips look like that are usually around 10 - 20 minutes. 

## Summary

Overall we were able to pull out a lot of useful information that will be useful when considering the bikesharing company in IA. Some of the biggest things include that mainly men and subscribers are the most interested, the peak hours of operation are usually 5pm and 6 pm and the peak days of the week are usually Thursday and Friday. Outside of this, 2 other visualizations I would recommend creating include a chart that shows the count of trips by birth age to understand the target market better and something that shows if certain genders maybe use certain stations over others more, which could be a way to understand what kind of marketing/ promotion needs to happen in that area.
